# maxjs
a JavaScript library framework for Max/Msp focusing on filling in the gaps of cycling74's implementation.  

### Current Contents
An automated JavaScript render for patch structures.  
Node-like imports/exports.
Demo patches and scripts.

## Motivation

JavasSript development for Max could be much easier, faster and more sane.  My first goal is to create a globally accessable DOM like structure similar to [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom). I have a million ideas about where to take this but I'm more interested in hearing from others than writting up a full description this early in development.  

Questions? Comments? Suggestions? [Post here](https://github.com/NicholasThayer/maxjs/issues/new)
